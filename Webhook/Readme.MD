# Logic App Webhook 
In this example, we create a Logic App that is used as a Webhook to Graph Change Notifications.  To achieve this, there are several requirements that our Logic App must deal with.  When subscribing to Graph Change Notifications, Graph will first send a POST request to the Webhook (Logic App) with a Validation Token.  The Logic App must respond with a 200 status-code and must include in the response body the Validation Token as Plain Text that was sent to the Logic App.  Once the Validation Token Logic is in-place, you will need to implement logic to process the Change Notifications.  When Graph sends a change notification, it will send in the Request body a JSON array with the change notification details.  The Logic App should respond as quickly possible with a 202 status-code, the Response body should be empty.  At this point, you process the change notification JSON details per your needs.

### Let's implement the logic to parse the Validation Token ###

1. The first thing we need to do is add an HTTP Trigger <br>

2. Now we need to parse the Headers so we can extract the Content-Type (we will make use of these to determine if we are receiving a Validation Token or a Change Notification). Add a Parse JSON Action and use the schema below.<br>
![Parse Headers](/assets/ParseHeaders1.jpg)
    ~~~
    {
        "properties": {
            "headers": {
                "properties": {
                    "Accept": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                 "Connection": {
                        "type": "string"
                 },
                "Content-Length": {
                        "type": "string"
                 },
                 "Content-Type": {
                        "type": "string"
                 },
                 "Host": {
                        "type": "string"
                 }
            },
            "type": "object"
        }
        },
      "type": "object"
    }
    ~~~
 3. We need to initialize 3 variables and extract the Content-Type from the Headers and store that in a variable for processing later.<br>
 ![Initi Vars Store Content-Type](/assets/InitiVars-ContentType.jpg)
 
 4. Let's add a Switch Action so we can check the Content-Type for **text/plain** or for **application/json**. If the Content-Type is **text/plain** we know we have a Validation Token, if itâ€™s **application/json** we know we have a change notification and we can process accordingly. 
 ![Switch](/assets/Switch.jpg)
 
 5. Let's add the logic for the Validation Token, which means the Content-Type is set to **text/plain**.  We know that when we get a Validation Token that we need to respond with a 200 and also set the response body to be the Validation Token that was sent to us.<br>

6. Now, we need to add the logic for Change Notifications, which means the Content-Type is set to **application/json**.  In this case, the request body will need a different schema.<br>
![Switch](/assets/SwitchJSON.jpg)<br>
    The schema that you will use for the **Parse JSON HTTP Trigger Body** is as follows:
    ~~~
    {
    "properties": {
        "value": {
            "items": {
                "properties": {
                    "changeType": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "clientState": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "resource": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "resourceData": {
                        "properties": {
                            "@@odata.id": {
                                "type": "string"
                            },
                            "@@odata.type": {
                                "type": "string"
                            },
                            "activity": {
                                "type": "string"
                            },
                            "availability": {
                                "type": "string"
                            },
                            "id": {}
                        },
                        "type": "object"
                    },
                    "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "subscriptionId": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "tenantId": {
                        "type": "string"
                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "subscriptionId",
                    "clientState",
                    "changeType",
                    "resource",
                    "subscriptionExpirationDateTime",
                    "resourceData",
                    "tenantId"
                ],
                "type": "object"
            },
            "type": "array"
        }
    },
    "type": "object"
    }
    ~~~
    Note that in the **Compose MessageID** action I am able to extract that **id** of the message without using a Loop, which is much more efficient.  I am using the following expression to drill into the **id**.<br>
    ~~~
        body('Parse_JSON')['value'][0]['resourceData']['id']
    ~~~

### Let's implement the logic to parse the Validation Token ###

### Add business logic ### 
At this point, you would add your business logic to the ***application/json Case section***. For example, if you wanted to get the subject line of the message for a Shared Mailbox, you would need to implement the following logic.<br>

1. Send an HTTP POST request to https://login.microsoftonline.com/ to acquire an oAuth Token.  Since we are using Shared Mailboxes the Graph Permissions, we need can only be granted when using delegation, so we must use a Service Account for this.

### Create the Graph Subscription ###
In order to use this Logic App as a Webhook for a Graph Subscription, you will need to create the subscription.  Read the details in the following section for how to create the subscription.<br>
