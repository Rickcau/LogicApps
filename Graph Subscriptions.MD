# Examples
### Creating a Change Notification for subscription for emails in a Shared Mailbox ###
You can create a subscription by send a POST request to the subscriptions endpoint and in the Request body passing the proper JSON.  Below is an example of that the JSON shoujld look like.
~~~
{
   "changeType": "created",
   "notificationUrl": "<https://YOUR URL THAT WILL BE CALLED>",
   "resource": "/users/PoCSMB@XXX.onmicrosoft.com//mailfolders('inbox')/messages",
   "expirationDateTime":"2023-04-04T11:00:00Z",
   "clientState": "secretClientValue",
   "latestSupportedTlsVersion": "v1_2"
}
~~~
Below is a screenhot of what this would look like in Graph Explorer.
